==============

A list of cities from all countries was obtained from https://www.maxmind.com/en/worldcities.
The file was processed with an application written in Haskell (see the Haskell directory for details).
The files generated are:

directory _citynames_:

* citynames_ch.txt  
* citynames_de.txt  
* citynames_eg.txt  
* citynames_es.txt  
* citynames_fr.txt  
* citynames_it.txt  
* citynames_jp.txt  
* citynames_pl.txt

Each of these files contain tens of thousands of names.
